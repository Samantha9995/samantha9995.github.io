        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>TaskMind takes your privacy seriously. We do not actively collect any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, or phone number. Non-personally identifiable information refers to data that cannot be used to identify you as an individual.</p>
        <p>To improve the performance and user experience of the application, we use Google Analytics to collect the following non-personally identifiable information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Device model, operating system version, screen resolution, and anonymized IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>User Location</strong>: Country/region and city (used for statistical purposes only, not to track individuals).</li>
            <li><strong>Application Usage</strong>: Frequency of application use, feature usage, and interaction data.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the non-personally identifiable information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze application usage trends to understand how users interact with TaskMind. For example, if data shows frequent use of the task reminder feature, we may enhance its design or add customization options.</li>
            <li>Improve the performance and stability of the application.</li>
            <li>Develop new features and enhance existing ones.</li>
            <li>Provide a better user experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data collected through Google Analytics is retained for a limited period, typically up to 26 months, in accordance with its privacy policy.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We only share the non-personally identifiable information we collect with Google, the provider of Google Analytics. Google will use this information in accordance with its <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personally identifiable information, you do not need to exercise rights related to personal data, such as accessing, correcting, or deleting it. However, you can limit the collection of non-personally identifiable information by adjusting your device’s privacy settings or through in-app preferences, if available.</p>
